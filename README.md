# quine
Js program whose output and source code are identical.

A quine is a computer program (a kind of metaprogram) whose output and source code
are identical. As a challenge or for fun, some programmers try to write the shortest quine
in a given programming language.

The operation that consist of simply opening the source file and displaying it is considered cheating. More generally, a program that uses any data entry cannot be considered
a valid quine. A trivial solution is a program whose source code is empty. Indeed, the
execution of such a program produces for most languages no output, that is to say the
source code of the program.
